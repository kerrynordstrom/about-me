<!-- As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.
As a developer, I want to convert some of my appropriate biographical elements into unordered lists, such as my education summary and/or my work experience.
As a developer, I want to consider the user experience (UX) of my About Me and guessing game, trying to view it through the eyes of a user. Wait... maybe I should just write a user story for that...
As an end user of the About Me and guessing game, I want to have an informative, interesting, and fun experience in learning about the developer.
As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception. -->
